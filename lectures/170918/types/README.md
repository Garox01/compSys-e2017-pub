# Intel Types vs C Types

[`store.c`](store.c) is a simple C data store: it can store one variable of a
given type. The type of the variable is given as a preprocessor macro declared
at compile-time.

Looking at the assembly generated for the `set_value` function we can see how
different `mov` instructions and different register selectors are used,
depending on the given type.

`make` will exhibit the assembly code generated when `TYPE` is `char`. `make
TYPE=int` will exhibit it when the `TYPE` is `int`. Similarly for other basic C
types.

By default, `make` will use the `show-store` target. This shows the assembly
code generated by GCC. There are notational differences between this and the
result of _disassembling_ the store object file. The latter is what the
`dump-store` target is for. You can compare the two as follows:

```
$ make TYPE=long show-store
$ make TYPE=long dump-store
```
