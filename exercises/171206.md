# Exercises for Wednesday Jan 6, 2017

## Today you need to read and understand the code snippets for network programming in BOH. We have covered these in the lectures but you need to understand them thoroughly. 

* Understand rio functions
  * rio_readn, rio_writen (Fig 10.4 BOH page 935)
  * rio_read (Fig 10.7 BOH page 937)
  * rio_readlineb, rio_readnb (Fig 10.8 BOH page 938)
  * Read and understand Section 10.11 (especially directives G1,G2,G3) in BOH page 947-948
  * Using rio functions are not strictly necessary you can use UNIX I/O functions but they simplify programming a lot

* Understand socket interface
  * hostinfo example code (Fig 11.17 BOH page 977)
  * open_clientfd code (Fig 11.18 BOH page 979)
  * open_listenfd code (Fig 11.19 BOH page 981)
  * Echo client/iterative server example code (Fig 11.20 - 11.22 BOH page 982-983)
  * Using the wrapper functions is optional but they simplify programming a lot

* Understand different concurrent server implementations
  * Process-based echo server (Fig 12.5 BOH page 1012)
  * Iterative (Fig 12.6 BOH page 1015) and concurrent echo server (Fig 12.8 - 12.11 BOH page 1018 - 1020) based on I/O multiplexing
  * Thread-based echo server (Fig 12.14 BOH page 1027)
  * Pre-threaded echo server (Fig 12.28 BOH page 1047)

* (*Optional*) Look at the code snippets of the tiny web server implementation (Fig 11.29 - 11.35 BOH page 993 - 999)
