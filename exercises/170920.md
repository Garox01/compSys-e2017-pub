# Exercises for Wednesday 20th Sept 2017

## Familiarize yourself with the assembler and the reference 
simulator for A2 and A3.

Check them out from github and build them.

## Get started learning the subset of x86 we'll use in A2 (and A3).

Write a few very, very simple programs using *only* the subset of x86 
chosen for A2.

Assemble your programs and run them on the reference simulator to verify 
they work.

## Understand the datapath suggested for A2.

1. Go through each of the instructions in the x86 subset, and pinpoint 
   how the datapath will execute the instruction. Determine which values 
   flow from where and whereto.
   
2. Add the signals needed to control the datapath for all the instructions.

3. Determine how each of these control signals should be generated.
