# Exercises for 12/9-2017

These exercises are intended to give you some practice with working with bit representation.

For all of the below, you should use `make` to build your programs. To
parametrize `make` to build with all the necessary compiler flags, start by
writing down a `Makefile` containing the following:

```
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-std=c11 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -g
```

Now, to compile the programs below, just `make` them. For example:

```
$ make badd
```


## `./bitflip value index`
Make a program in C that takes a `value` (parsed from an integral 64-bit value) and an `index` (integral between 0 and 63) and negates the `index`'th bit in the binary representation of `value`. The function should print the updated `value` and return `EXIT_SUCCESS`.

If the number of arguments is different from two indicate this by printing appropriate text to the user and return `EXIT_FAILURE`. If either `value` or `index` does not parse as an integral value indicate this by printing and return `EXIT_FAILURE`. It `index` is out of bounds indicate this by printing and return `EXIT_SUCCESS`.


## `./badd a b`
Write a C program that given two 64-bit integral values, `a` and `b`, calculates the sum of `a` and `b` using the method of a binary ripple-carry adder. (See textbook.)
You program should print the sum and a possible overflow bit and return `EXIT_SUCCESS`.

If the number of arguments is different from two indicate this by printing appropriate text to the user and return `EXIT_FAILURE`. If either `value` or `index` does not parse as an integral value indicate this by printing and return `EXIT_FAILURE`.

## Play integer arithmetic
Here it is! The sequel to the [Integer representation game](https://games.onlineta.org/integers.html)

Make a winning streak at the [interger arithmetic game](https://games.onlineta.org/integer-arithmetic.html). 

The critics are saying:
* [PC Gamer](http://www.pcgamer.com/): "This is the new Counter Strike!" 
* [Game Informer](http://www.gameinformer.com/): "Have taken the world with storm! Who would have thought arithmetic was so much fun."

## Play floating points
Are intergers too easy. Don't miss the [Floating point game](https://games.onlineta.org/floating-point.html).
