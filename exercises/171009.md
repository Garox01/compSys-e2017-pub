## Simulation of cache in C (larger)
In for this assignment you must implement a cache simulator in C. 
The cache must be 2-way associative and contain 32 blocks of each 16 bytes. The cache is of the write-back type and use LRU-replacement on eviction.
Addresses should be 16-bit byte addresses given in hexadecimal format.

In `171009/cache/` you find the following files:
 * `cache.c` that is the main program that calls your cache implementation.
 * `hexstream.[h,c]` that is a library for reading hex addresses from a file.
 * `cachelog.[h,c]` that is a library you \emph{must} use from printing cache hit of miss.
 * `example.hex` that is a nonsense example files of hex addresses.
 * `Makefile` to help you compile.

Write a C program that simulates the cache above. You implementation must be called from `cache.c` and should read
a stream of addresses in hexadecimal notation from an input file as exemplified in `example.hex`. Use the `hexstream`
library to read the input files. Each address indicated a sequence of reads. For each address you must log if

 * the given address was a cache hit using the `log_cache_hit` function, or
 * the given address was a cache miss using the `log_cache_miss` function.

See `cachelog.h` for usage of the two functions.

Write a some hex-dump files as `example.hex` that tests your implementation. Consider the coverage of your tests.
