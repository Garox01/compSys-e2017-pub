# Exercises for Wednesday 27th Sept 2017

## Prioritize A2

Figure out what you don't know, but need to know.

Possibly revisit the exercises from 20th Sept 2017,
go through them again using the knowledge you've gained since.

Go through the main() function in main.c and help each other
understand what goes on.


## Plenty of time?

If you have additional time, figure out how alu.c works.
