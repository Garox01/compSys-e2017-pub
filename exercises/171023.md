# Exercises for Monday 23rd of October

## Effect of conditional moves

We handed out two versions of heapsort: "heapsort.x64" and "heapsort-2.x64".

1. What is the difference between the two versions?

Section 5.11.2 is about the cost of branch mispredictions and describes
how you may want to write code to avoid hard-to-predict branches by
using conditional moves.

Read section 5.11.2 carefully.

2. Use the performance simulators profiling option (-prof) to confirm 
   that a hard-to-predict branch is present in heapsort-2.x64, but not 
   in heapsort.x64

Note also (as an effect of the hard to predict branch) that overall
branch prediction rate is much worse for heapsort-2 than for heapsort.

Based on the presentation in section 5.11.2, you'd expect heapsort to
be faster than heapsort-2.

If you measure heapsort and heapsort-2 for the 3 machine models defined
in A3 you'll discover that the book is right about the performance when
the program is run on either the simple or the superscalar pipeline,
but for the out-of-order pipeline the situation is reversed.

3. Explain why heapsort-2 is faster on the out-of-order machine.

Possible hint: run the two programs with the "-ddep-only" option
and note the IPC (instructions per cycle) for the 2 programs. 

## Work on A3.

Discuss which of the many optimization techniques given in chapter 5
could be relevant to solving A3.
